Database Setup:
Set up a MySQL database to store product information (e.g., name, description, price, image URL).
Create a table (e.g., Products) with relevant columns to store shoe details.
Front-End (HTML/CSS/JavaScript):
Design your homepage with shoe thumbnails (images) representing each product.
When a user clicks on a thumbnail, use JavaScript to handle the click event.
Display detailed information about the selected shoe (name, description, price).
PHP Back-End:
Create a PHP file (e.g., product.php) to handle individual product pages.
Retrieve product details from the database based on the product ID.
Display the retrieved information dynamically on the product page.
Sample PHP Code:
Hereâ€™s a simplified example of how you can create a product page using PHP:
PHP

<!-- product.php -->
<?php
// Connect to the database (you'll need your own database credentials)
$db_host = 'localhost';
$db_user = 'your_db_user';
$db_pass = 'your_db_password';
$db_name = 'your_db_name';

$conn = mysqli_connect($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass, $db_name);

// Get product ID from the URL (e.g., product.php?id=123)
$product_id = $_GET['id'];

// Retrieve product details from the database
$query = "SELECT * FROM Products WHERE product_id = $product_id";
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);
$product = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);

// Close the database connection
mysqli_close($conn);
?>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title><?php echo $product['name']; ?></title>
    <!-- Add your CSS styles here -->
</head>
<body>
    <h1><?php echo $product['name']; ?></h1>
    <p><?php echo $product['description']; ?></p>
    <p>Price: $<?php echo $product['price']; ?></p>
    <img src="<?php echo $product['image_url']; ?>" alt="<?php echo $product['name']; ?>">
    <!-- Add more product details as needed -->
</body>
</html>
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
URL Structure:
Each product should have a unique URL (e.g., product.php?id=123).
Use the product ID to fetch the correct product details from the database.
Security Considerations:
Validate user input (e.g., product ID) to prevent SQL injection.
Protect against unauthorized access to product details.
Remember to adapt this example to your specific project requirements and styling. Happy coding! ðŸ‘ŸðŸŒŸ
